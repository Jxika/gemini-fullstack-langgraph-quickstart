      "\n",
      "1.  **OpenAI's Sora (Text-to-Video Model):** Announced in February 2024, Sora represents a major leap in generative AI's ability to create realistic and coherent videos from text prompts. Unlike previous video generation models, Sora can produce longer, more complex scenes with multiple characters, specific motion, and accurate rendering of object physics within the generated world, significantly advancing the realism and control in video synthesis.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Google DeepMind's AlphaFold 3 (Universal Biomolecular Prediction):** Unveiled in May 2024, AlphaFold 3 extends the groundbreaking work of its predecessors by predicting the structure and interactions of *all* biomolecules, not just proteins. This includes DNA, RNA, proteins, and ligands, as well as modifications to these molecules. This holistic view of the \"molecules of life\" is a monumental scientific breakthrough, promising to revolutionize drug discovery, disease understanding, and fundamental biological research.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **OpenAI's GPT-4o (Omni) Multimodal Model:** Announced in May 2024, GPT-4o (o for \"omni\") sets a new standard for real-time, multimodal interaction. It can seamlessly process and generate text, audio, and images. Its most striking feature is its ability to engage in natural, real-time voice conversations, including detecting and expressing emotion, interpreting visual input through a camera, and responding with human-like latency. This marks a significant step towards more intuitive and human-like AI interaction.\n"
